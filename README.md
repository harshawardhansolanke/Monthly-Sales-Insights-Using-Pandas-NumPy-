# Monthly-Sales-Insights-Using-Pandas-NumPy-
This project is a friendly data analysis program built using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
It demonstrates how to create a dataset, perform calculations, analyze business data, and visualize results through line charts.

# Project Overview-
The program creates a sample dataset containing monthly Sales, Expenses, and automatically calculates Profit using NumPy. Pandas is used for data manipulation and generating insights such as:

1. Total Sales
2. Average Monthly Sales
3. Highest Sales Month

A line graph is plotted using Matplotlib to visually compare Sales, Expenses, and Profit across months.

# Technologies Used-
1. Python
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib

# Key Features-

1. Dataset creation using Python dictionaries
2. DataFrame operations with Pandas
3. Profit calculation using NumPy arrays
4. Summary statistics (sum, mean, max)
5. Line chart visualization with Matplotlib
6. Friendly and easy to explain
